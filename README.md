### Hi There! This is my new GitHub account 

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Although this account is new, I'd like to share that I have a history of active contributions and numerous repositories on my original GitHub account, which is currently hidden from public view (for 1 - 2 months).

## About My Previous GitHub Account

ðŸ”— **GitHub Handle:** [atikur-24]

ðŸ“… **Contributions Period:** [2022] - [Present]

During my time on my original GitHub account, I actively contributed to various projects and created multiple repositories. Unfortunately, due to certain reasons, that account is currently hidden from public view.

## What You Can Expect

ðŸš€ Despite the recent creation of this new GitHub account, I bring with me a wealth of experience and a history of meaningful contributions. In the coming weeks and months, I plan to migrate and showcase some of the notable projects from my previous account to this one.

## Stay Tuned!

I appreciate your interest in my work, and I'm excited to continue building and sharing projects with the GitHub community. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš§âœ¨
